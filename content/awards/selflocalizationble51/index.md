title: Evaluating a Novel Bluetooth 5.1 AoA Approach for Low-Cost Indoor Vehicle Tracking via Simulation 

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: The recent Bluetooth 5.1 specification introduced the use of Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information which enables the design of novel low-cost indoor positioning systems. In this paper, we instead present an approach where mobile receivers are equipped with antenna arrays, and the fixed infrastructure is composed of battery-powered beacons. We evaluated the solution as a function of the number of beacons, their transmission period, and algorithmic parameters of the position estimation. Sub-meter accuracy is achievable using 1.6 beacons per 10 m 2 and a beacon transmission period of 500 ms.
