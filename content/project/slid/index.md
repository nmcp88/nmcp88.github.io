The SLID project focuses on the development of a product that can be used in cargo vehicles and indirectly track the location and movement of all products in stock, in all logistical scenarios.

In this sense, this innovation will be able to locate the vehicle – with low-cost infrastructures and easy installation – and to identify the products being transported, as well as the moment they are loaded and unloaded.

By the end of the project, the solution is expected to improve the logistical efficiency of industrial (or other) units that wish to reduce the number of product and inventory errors and to increase the automation of diverse processes, such as verifying the adequate shipment of objects.
