title: WHERE.IS
summary: The WHERE.IS project aims to develop an asset localization and management solution with focus on the ease of deployment and maintenance. The solution is a good fit for situations where there is a large number number of slow moving assets, a rough position estimation is enough, zone-level or room-level accuracy, true real-time is not needed, and information with 5 minute delay is acceptable.

Nowadays, there is a growing need of organizations for fixed and mobile asset management solutions.

This comes from the widespread economic development and the growth of the organizations themselves, leading to an increasing number of goods to manage in a large number of rooms or divisions. Many of these goods spend a lot of time stopped at the same location, but locating them in a very large space can take a considerable amount of time. Moreover, there is a lack of information about the history of the usage and movement of each asset, making management decisions difficult and based on hints.

The goals of WHERE.IS are too provide asset localization and management for organizations with assets moving through a large amount of areas or rooms, e.g.: hospitals, hotels, concert halls, schools, warehouses and manufacturing. This helps organizations improve their asset management processes by decreasing the amount of time spent locating assets, monitoring the amount of time each asset spent on each location, and providing the approximate movements of each asset.
