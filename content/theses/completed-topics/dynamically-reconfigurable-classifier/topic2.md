### Work Plan

- System partitioning and specification of the main modules
- Implementation and validation of a single K-NN core
- Design space exploration: characterizing the impact of the main system parameters on cost and performance
- Design and deployment of a dynamically reconfigurable infrastructure for multiple K-NN cores
- System validation with standard benchmark data sets;
- Writing up the dissertation
