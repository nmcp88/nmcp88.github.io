### Description

 _In this thesis, the technology of indoor location based on the specifications’ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.1’s Angle of Arrival Angle of Arrival (AoA) was analyzed, which allowed for a good location accuracy with low costs. The development of this project began with a brief study about the existing technologies to understand the proposed one. The project consists in sending and receiving radiofrequency waves, with Bluetooth technology and Angle of Arrival technique, using an antenna on the transmitter and an antenna array on the receiver. To understand how it works, a study of the technology and its components is carried out. Through customized hardware it was possible to analyze and develop Octave code for a better understanding of the technology, which allowed us to obtain predictions about its practical operation. The debugging of results took into consideration the simulations and the environment tests. The results’ debugging took into account the necessary functions for the phase difference’s calcultions, fundamental for the calculation of the incident angle. These functions use the received packets from the microcontroler through the Radio Frequency (RF) lane connected to the switch. The tests carried out allowed us to obtain angles of arrival of radio-frequency waves and the position of the device. However, it must be consider the existing system noise and obstacles present in the environment._
